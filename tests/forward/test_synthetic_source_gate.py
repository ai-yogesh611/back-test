"""The synthetic kill-switch is config-driven and has no fallback (2026-09-30).

The bug these tests pin was not a missing flag — ``config/data_sources.yaml``
already disabled synthetic — it was that the flag was consulted in exactly one
place (the backtest/optimize request guard) while every other component that
picks a data source still had its own hard-coded default or its own labelled
fallback:

* ``api/portfolio.py`` created a runner with ``source or "synthetic"``;
* ``PortfolioManager`` built the 1s random-walk feed unconditionally and routed
  anything not exactly ``"mstock"`` onto it;
* ``option_quote_provider_for`` answered a broker request with Black-Scholes
  chains when no session was authenticated;
* ``runner.build_source`` returned a ``SyntheticSource`` for anyone who asked.

So a runner displayed as ``paper/MSTOCK`` while pricing and filling on
generated candles. The rule now: **when the policy says synthetic is off, no
path reaches synthetic — not by choice, not by default, not as a fallback.**
The code is not deleted; the deployment that wants it sets
``BACKTEST_DATA_PROFILE=testing``, which is exactly what ``tests/conftest.py``
does for the suite.
