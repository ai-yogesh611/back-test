"""multi-broker segments & execution routing (MIG-001, PRD-001 Phase B/C)

Multi-Broker Capital Allocation & Segmented Trading: a runner (portfolio)
may now belong to a *segment* (a capital partition mapped to one execution
broker), and every position/order remembers WHICH broker holds/filled it —
the audit trail LOM's venue-first rule and per-broker reconcile need.

* ``portfolios.segment``           — segment name ('' = no segment, legacy)
* ``portfolios.execution_broker``  — broker the runner routes orders to
  ('' = paper / legacy default broker)
* ``positions.broker``             — broker holding the position
  ('paper' = simulated)
* ``orders.broker``                — broker the order was sent to

No values are guessed for existing rows: everything backfills to the legacy
single-broker labels, which is exactly what those rows were.

This revision is the Alembic equivalent of the hand-applied
``db/migrations/006_multi_broker_segments.sql``. Use ONE of the two paths,
not both (see revision 001's header)::

    alembic stamp 006   # if you already applied the SQL by hand
