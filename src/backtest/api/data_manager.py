"""Data Manager API endpoints.

Endpoints for fetching historical market data from mStock and storing in PostgreSQL.
Runs fetch jobs as background threads with progress tracking.

* POST /api/data/fetch       — Start a fetch job
* GET  /api/data/status       — Get current fetch job status + progress
* POST /api/data/stop         — Stop the current fetch job
* GET  /api/data/inventory    — Show what data is available in DB per symbol
* GET  /api/data/coverage     — Every KNOWN instrument + whether it has bars

    """Fetch OHLCV bars from mStock, chunked by date range.

    Returns ``(bars, chunk_errors)`` — the error count lets the caller mark a
    symbol as FAILED when every chunk request errored (e.g. an expired broker
    session returning 401 for all of them) instead of reporting a silent
    zero-bar "success".

    ``should_cancel`` is checked before every chunk so a Stop request lands
    within seconds even for a wide date range at 1-minute granularity
    (the per-symbol cancel check alone left the user watching a single
    symbol churn through hundreds of chunks).

    ``on_progress(done, total)`` is called after every completed chunk so the
    UI can draw a moving bar inside a multi-minute symbol.

    Chunks run ``workers`` threads deep (default ``CHUNK_FETCH_WORKERS``) —
    the loop is pure network waiting, so serialising it left 3/4 of the
    session's usable throughput unused. Pacing is shared state under
    ``pace_lock``: a burst of ``CHUNK_PACE_UP_AFTER`` consecutive failures
    widens the sleep for ALL workers (bad mStock hours self-throttle), and
    ``CHUNK_PACE_DOWN_AFTER`` clean chunks decay one worker back to base
    cadence at a time. ``workers=1`` makes the loop fully sequential, which
    the pacing-rhythm tests rely on.

    ``windows`` — when given, exactly these ``(start, end)`` windows are
    fetched instead of the full ``[from_date, to_date]`` walk. The caller uses
    it to drop windows whose days are already in the DB (coverage-aware gap
    fill); omitted, the whole range is built so existing callers are unchanged.

    ``breaker`` — the job's :class:`_CircuitBreaker`. Every post-retry chunk
    outcome is recorded on it, and once it has tripped the remaining windows
    short-circuit as *cancelled* (no request is fired), so a full mStock
    outage ends the walk in seconds instead of days.
