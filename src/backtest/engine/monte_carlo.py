"""Monte Carlo over a result's trade sequence (PRD backTest-enhance §3.3).

Asks: *was this result lucky, or would it have happened in most orderings of the
same trades?*

**The PRD's literal specification is vacuous for half of what it asks for, and
that is worth stating plainly rather than quietly working around.**

Shuffling a list of trade P&Ls changes the path, never the sum. So for the
1,000 reorderings the PRD describes:

* final equity is **identical in every simulation** — mean, median, 5th and
  95th percentile alike;
* "probability of profit" is exactly 100% or exactly 0%, decided entirely by
  the sign of the total, with no reference to any particular ordering.

Reporting those as "median final equity ₹X" and "P(profit) 79%" would put four
identical numbers on the page in a table that looks like a distribution, and a
reader would reasonably conclude the tool had measured something.

So this module runs **two** resamplings and keeps them apart:

``reorder``
    The PRD's shuffle, WITH replacement disabled. This is a genuine test of
    *path dependence*: the same trades in a different order can produce a very
    different drawdown even though the ending is identical. It answers "could
    I have been underwater for twice as long?".

``bootstrap``
    Resample WITH replacement, so the *multiset* of trades changes too. This is
    the only one of the two whose final-equity distribution means anything, and
    it answers the question the PRD's percentiles were reaching for: "would a
    similar sequence of results have produced a different ending?"

A second PRD rule is unreachable for the same structural reason, and is
replaced rather than shipped dead: *"if the actual result is above the 90th
percentile of simulations"* can never fire. The actual sample **defines** the
empirical distribution being resampled, so it sits at roughly the 50th-75th
percentile of its own bootstrap no matter what the trades look like — the
ceiling is about 0.74 for any n (verified in
``test_run_checks.py::test_the_actual_percentile_has_a_mathematical_ceiling``).
A rule that can never fire is a feature that only ever looks correct, so the
"was this one lucky trade?" question is asked directly instead, via
:func:`trade_concentration`.
