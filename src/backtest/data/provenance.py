"""Run provenance — *which* engine and *which* data produced these numbers.

Implements PRD ``docs/backTest-enhance.md`` Part 1 §1.1 (engine consistency)
and §1.2 (data-source visibility). Two numbers on screen are only meaningful
together with their provenance: a Sharpe of 1.4 from the fill-exact engine on
real prices is a different claim from the same Sharpe from the quick-screen
engine on a random walk.

Single authority for the labels — the API stamps the payload, the templates
and JS render it, and no page re-declares "Synthetic"/"Real (PostgreSQL)"
itself. Mirrors :mod:`backtest.data.source_tags`, which answers a different
question (the three-way run-classification taxonomy, not what the operator
needs to read on a results page).

Every payload is a plain dict of JSON-native values, so it can ride along in
the ``to_all()`` result and in a stored run row without a serialiser.
