    """Resolve a caller's ``start``/``end`` into a **half-open** ``[lo, hi)``.

    ``end`` means "up to and including this date", which is what every caller
    in this repo means by it: the UI's picker is an ``<input type="date">``, the
    API documents ``to_date``, and the Data tab's own coverage query uses
    ``ts::date <= :to_date``. Comparing a timestamp column directly against a
    bare date (``ts BETWEEN :start AND :end``) resolves to midnight and
    therefore drops the ENTIRE final session — one day of a one-month run, and
    every bar of a single-day run. Both are silent: the query succeeds and
    returns a shorter frame.

    So: a date-only ``end`` is widened to the next midnight and compared with
    ``<``. An ``end`` that carries a clock time is treated as an instant and
    kept inclusive (``<=``) — no caller does that today, but a mid-session
    cut-off is a sensible thing to ask for and should not be silently widened
    by a day.

    ``start`` needs no adjustment: ``ts >= '2026-09-02'`` already includes the
    whole first session on both backends.
